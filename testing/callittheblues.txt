Don't wish it away
don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me
I could honestly say
that things can only get better

And while i'm away
dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long
before you and me run
to the place in our hearts
where we hide

And I guess thats why
they call it the blues
Time on my hands
could be time spent with you

Laughing like children 
Living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess thats why
they call it the blues

Just stare into space
picture my face in your hands
Live for each second
without hesitation
and never forget I'm your man

Wait on me girl
I cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever
I simply love you
more than I love life itself

And I guess thats
why they call it the blues
Time on my hands
could be time spent with you
Laughing like children
living like lovers
rolling like thunder
under the covers
And I guess thats why
they call it the blues

Wait on me girl
cry in the night if it helps
More than ever
I simply love you
more than I love life itself

And I guess thats why
they call it the blues
Time on my hands
Could be time spent with you
Laughing like children
living like lovers
rolling like thunder
under the covers
And I guess thats why
they call it the blues

And I guess thats why
they call it the blues

And I guess thats why
they call it the blues

And i guess thats why
they call it the blues
